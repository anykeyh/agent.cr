  #   - `message_channel` (size 1) and `usage_channel` (size 1): legitimate
  #     one-shot futures for the final message and usage metadata.
  #   - Shared flags (@done, @cancelled, @stream_state, @finish_reason, @error)
  #     are protected by a Mutex. The old `cancel_channel` (unconsumed) has
  #     been removed in favor of a mutex-protected bool.
