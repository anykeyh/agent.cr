## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- History trimming drops whole turns. A turn is a user message and
  everything up to the next one, so `max_history` now counts conversation
  turns as documented, the kept history always starts at a user message,
  and a tool result is never left without the assistant message that called
  it (previously a tool-call turn could be cut in the middle, and the next
  request rejected by the API).
- Streamed completions report token counts: the OpenAI provider sends
  `stream_options: {include_usage: true}`, without which OpenAI, Ollama,
  vLLM and others return no `usage` on a stream and `Response#metadata` was
  all nil. `Agent::Config.new(include_usage: false)` turns it off for a
  server that rejects the field.
- An API error with a body (429, 400, 500) no longer breaks the next
  request on the agent. The unread body stayed on the kept-alive connection
  and was read as the next response (`Unsupported HTTP version: {...`). The
  HTTP client is now rebuilt after every failure.
- A consumer that leaves `Response#stream` early (`break`, or an exception
  such as a disconnected client) no longer blocks the agent fiber forever
  once 256 chunks are queued.
- A call to an unregistered or disabled tool gets an error result and the
  loop continues. Before, the whole message went back to the caller after
  the registered tools in it had already run, discarding their results and
  leaving history that the API rejects. A message that calls a per-request
  tool still goes back to the caller, now before any tool runs.
- Tool calls left without a result (no `ask(tool_results)` follow-up, or a
  turn that failed midway) are answered with an error result at the start
  of the next turn instead of making every later request fail.
- A provider call failing after the first call of a tool loop no longer
  removes the last tool result from history; the turn is kept. The
  response's `metadata` reports the usage of the calls that succeeded, on
  every error and on cancel, instead of nothing.
- A cancelled turn drops the tool calls it streamed instead of keeping them
  in history without results.
- An exception from a `Handler` or the provider finishes the response with
  that error. Before, it killed the agent fiber, and every later `#ask` hung.
- A `null` token count or tool-call `index` in the stream no longer fails
  the request.
- `Agent#close` no longer closes the HTTP client under a request in flight.
  On TLS that shut down the session while the agent fiber was mid-read on
  it. The call in flight now finishes, the turn ends with a closed error
  instead of continuing its tool loop, and the agent fiber releases the
  client and provider as it exits.
- A tool callback's exception message no longer reaches the model. It is
  logged, and the model sees `Error executing tool 'x': the tool failed`.
  Raise `Agent::ToolError` for a message the model should see.

### Added

- `Agent::ToolError`: raise it from a tool callback to show the model why
  the tool failed.
- `ToolCallContext#error`: the exception a tool callback raised, set when
  `next_proc` returns. A handler can record it, or match on a `ToolError`
  subclass carrying its own fields and return a different result for the
  model.

- `Usage#cached_tokens` and `Usage#cache_creation_tokens`: the prompt
  tokens served from the provider's prompt cache and written to it. The
  OpenAI parser fills `cached_tokens` from `prompt_tokens_details`; both
  sum with `+` like the other fields.
- `Message#is_error` on tool results (`Message.tool_result(tc, text,
  is_error: true)`, `Message#error?`). The agent loop sets it on the
  results it builds for a tool that raised, had no callback, or whose
  arguments failed to parse or validate. The OpenAI wire format has no such
  flag and ignores it; a custom provider whose format does (Anthropic's
  `tool_result` block) can send it.
- `Message#provider_data : JSON::Any?`: an opaque slot for what a custom
  provider needs to replay a message exactly (signed reasoning blocks,
  citations). Kept through `dump`/`load`, compared by `==`, never sent by
  the OpenAI provider.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-19

### Fixed

- Tool-argument validation no longer skips the type check for JSON `null`.
  A `null` argument against a property that declares a `type` (e.g.
  `{"type": "array"}`) is now rejected with
  `Field '<name>' expected type '<type>', got 'null'`, giving the model a
  structured signal to self-correct. `null` still passes for properties that
  declare no `type` and for arguments absent from `properties`.
- `validate_tool_args` no longer raises (and kills the agent fiber) on schemas
  that declare `type` as an array of alternatives, e.g. `"type": ["string",
  "null"]`.

### Added

- Tool-argument validation honours `items` on array properties: elements of
  the wrong type are rejected with `Field '<name>' expected array items of
  type '<type>', got '<actual>' at index <i>`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-30

First stable release. This patch release hardens the tool auto-resolve loop
and the background agent fiber, and replaces string-prefix error detection
with structured exception types.

### Fixed

- **Critical: Duplicate tool results in auto-resolve loop** (#1). Tool-result
  messages were being appended to history twice, causing malformed API requests.
- **Critical: Raising tool callbacks kill the agent fiber** (#2). A tool callback
  that raised an exception would silently terminate the background fiber,
  blocking all future `#ask` calls. Callback errors are now captured and returned
  as tool-result messages.
- **Critical: `#reset` races with in-flight requests** (#3). `#reset` now routes
  through the request channel, serializing with any pending request and waiting
  for it to complete before clearing history.
- String-prefix error detection replaced with structured error types (#4/#5).
  Added `Agent::Error`, `Agent::ConnectionError`, `Agent::ApiError`,
  `Agent::ToolError` exception classes and `Response#error?` / `Response#error`.
- SSE parser now handles `data:` (without trailing space) per the SSE spec (#24).
- `ToolCallDelta.id` and `name` use assignment (`=`) instead of `+=` (#17).
- `max_history` trimming now correctly counts user/assistant roles, avoiding
  orphaned tool messages in agentic flows (#7).

### Changed

- Removed misleading `tags: "remote"` from all spec tests (#35). Tests use a
  local mock server and don't require a remote API.

### Added

- Tests for the auto-resolve tool loop, raising callbacks, `register_tool`
  without auto_execute, `max_history` trimming, and structured error responses
  (#32, #33, #34).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (#39).
- Updated `shard.yml` author (#38).
